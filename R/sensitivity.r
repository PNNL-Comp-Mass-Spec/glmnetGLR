#' Computes classification sensitivity from the confusion matrix summary based on
#' a set of predicted and truth classes for a signature.
#'
#' For each class, we calculate the classification sensitivity in order to
#' summarize its performance for the signature. We compute one of two aggregate
#' scores, to summarize the overall performance of the signature.
#'
#' We suppose that an observation can be classified into one
#' (and only one) of K classes. For the jth class (j = 1, ..., K), we define
#' the sensitivity as the conditional probability
#'
#' Sensitivity_j = Pr(y_hat = j | y = j),
#'
#' where y_hat and y are the empirical and true classifications,
#' respectively.
#'
#' To estimate sensitivity_j for the jth class, we compute
#'
#' (TP_j) / (TP_j + FN_j),
#'
#' where TP_j and FN_j are the true positives and false negatives,
#' respectively. More specifically, TP_j is the number of observations
#' that we correctly classified into the jth class, and FN_j is
#' is the number of observations that we should have classified into class j
#' but failed to do so.
#'
#' The two aggregate score options are the macro- and micro-aggregate (average)
#' scores. The macro-aggregate score is the arithmetic mean of the binary scores
#' for each class. The micro-aggregate score is a weighted average of each class'
#' binary score, where the weights are determined by the sample sizes for each
#' class. By default, we use the micro-aggregate score because it is more robust,
#' but the macro-aggregate score might be more intuitive to some users.
#' 
#' In statistical terms, notice that in the binary case (K = 2), the sensitivity
#' is the recall.
#'
#' Also, note that the sensitivity is equal to the TPR.
#'
#' The sensitivity measure ranges from 0 to 1 with 1 being the optimal value.
