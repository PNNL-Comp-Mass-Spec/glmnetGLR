glmnetGLR
=========

## Abstract

The goal of this project was to build a classifier that accurately predicts a binary response. 
The resulting solution uses a Lasso logistic regression classifier (LLRC), which simultaneously restricts 
the size of model coefficients and the number of quality metrics included the model. 
Importantly the model does not treat false-negatives and false-positives as equally deleterious events.
