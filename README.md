=========

The primary goal was to build a classifier that accurately predicts a binary response. We utilized a Lasso logistic regression classifier (LLRC) which simultaneously restricts the size of model coefficients and the number of quality metrics included the model. Importantly the model does not treat false-negatives and false-positives as equally deleterious events.
